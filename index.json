We build a small open economy model with nominal rigidity, endogenous growth through the introduction of new products, and time-varying volatility of import tariffs. Import tariff uncertainty shocks act as aggregate supply shocks. They cause a temporary improvement of the current account along with the real exchange rate appreciation in the medium run. In addition, an increase in import tariff uncertainty causes a sharp decline in the introduction of new intermediate products, which is detrimental to productivity growth and prolongs the effect of the shock. We show that endogenous risk premia is the key channel transmitting the shock to the broader economy and study role monetary policy in shaping it.

The persistence of the output response is driven by a slowdown in productivity growth and capital accumulation. To interpret these stylized facts, I construct a two-agent (borrower-saver) dynamic general equilibrium model with occasionally binding collateral constraint tied to housing equity. Productivity grows endogenously in the model through forward-looking innovation investment. When the preexisting level of debt is sufficiently high, negative housing demand shocks cause the collateral constraint to bind and trigger deleveraging. The endogenous slowdown in TFP growth emerges as one of the adjustment margins during this process, prolonging the real effects of a crisis. The initial shock is amplified by a negative feedback loop between deleveraging, borrowers' housing wealth, and growth. I use the calibrated model to draw implications for macroeconomic policy during episodes of deleveraging.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Housing market cycles, productivity growth, and household debt","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dmitry Brizhatyuk"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Slides button above to demo Academic\u0026rsquo;s Markdown slides feature.

This paper emphasizes the role of occasionally binding credit constraints that cause state dependence and asymmetry in the link between economic activity and endogenous growth. Negative shocks are more detrimental to TFP growth in financially vulnerable economies prone to leverage-deleverage cycles than in economies that can optimally borrow through the cycle.
